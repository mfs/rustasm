## RUSTASM

I'm currently writing an [Intel 4004 emulator][box] and have started writing an
assembler for it. Unfortunately while I have written a compiler before I have
not written an assembler. I was going to just jump straight into it however have
decided to do some research first. I'm reading [Assemblers and Loaders][asl] by
David Salomon. I should be able to write a simple amd64 assembler after reading
the first two or three chapters. I'll leave out macros for now.

Currently very much a work in progress. Have decided to use [NOM][nom] for
parsing which I'm really enjoying the more I get the hang of it.
